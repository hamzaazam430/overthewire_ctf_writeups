# OverTheWire Wargames — Writeups

This repository contains concise, step-focused writeups for the **OverTheWire** wargames.
My goal: show *how* to solve each level — no fluff.
Where a short explanation is helpful, you'll find a single-line clarification; otherwise the writeup is **only the steps**.

## What you'll find

* Level-by-level writeups (one file per level)
* Clear, ordered commands and actions to reproduce the solution
* Minimal explanations only when needed for clarity or context

## File structure (convention)

```
/wargame-name/
  level0-0.md
  level0-1.md
  level1-2.md
  ...
```

Files contain numbered steps or command blocks. Use them as a learning aid or a quick reference while you practice.
